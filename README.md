# To-Do-And-Posts
## Description  
Welcome to my first Angular project  
With this app you can easily manage tasks and posts,organize them and even collaberate with team members.

## Project Description
This project is my first attempt to do a SPA site using a close framework like Angular.  
this fast paced deadline (two weeks) to harness the potential of Angular was a 
challanging experiment but fun none the less.  
The app is basic in the current stage but able to manage as simple flow of tasks and posts to a small group.  

## Technologies
In the front end i used Angular in a SPA architecture and of course JavaScript and TypeScript with Bootstrap.  
In the back end i used for the first time NodeJS.  
My DB was MongoDB.

## Side Notes
1.This is my second project.  
2.First time using Angular,Node and MongoDB.
